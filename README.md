## Horiseon Refactor Challenge

Horiseon, a marketing agency, has hired me to refactor their existing site to make it more accessible. In addition to this task, I also took it upon myself to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability (fixing deadlinks, cleaning up the css, etc). Below, is the finished site's URL. I included a screenshot of the site as well.
